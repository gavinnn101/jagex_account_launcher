# Jagex Account Launcher
Easily launch Jagex accounts via runelite. Logging in with your account credentials allows you to skip needing to switch Jagex accounts in the Jagex launcher if you have multiple osrs accounts on different Jagex accounts.

# Setup

* Open `settings.json` and set your `runelite_install_path`. This will typically be the default value with the `your_username` changed to your computer username.
* Open `accounts.json` and set your account credentials for each account you want to manage with the launcher.
* * You can add or remove as many entries from the file as you want.
* * Each entry such as `acc1`, `acc2`, etc can be changed to whatever you want, and can be used to launch an account.
* * If you don't know how to get your account's credentials:
* * * Follow [Runelite's wiki page](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Using-Jagex-Accounts) on how to get your account's `.runelite/credentials.properties` file and open it in your favorite text editor.
